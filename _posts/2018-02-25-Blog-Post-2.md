We did about 7 sections of the manual (10 pages) and we created a code for reading out the text, to make it easier to type and make more progress. Next week we should be able to make it to 'flashing lights' witch looks very interesting and I am looking forward to next week.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>
I still need to improve my typing speed as I am quite slow so I still prefer Rowan to type as he can touch type. I have begun a touch typing course and over the next few weeks i hope to improve greatly.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>
I will try to read the booklet quicker and try to be as effective as I can be when doing the fuse box to push as quickly as I can to the robot arms</td>
