  Today I will aimed to finish the section called 'flashing lights' and maybe even start with the robotic hands</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> 
    No, working on my own slowed me down significantly but I did  make a fair amount of progress and should without a doubt finish it next week.</td>

    <td>
I found that reading then typing was good and easy to do and I also think that next week if i work on my own I should us the advantages of my touch typing and exploit it more.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>
This week not much limited my learning, nothing apart from the tricky placement of the wires and holes which still infuriates me to a point of rage.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
I will try to read the booklet quicker and try to be as effective as I can be when doing the fuse box to push as quickly as I can to the robot arms</td>
