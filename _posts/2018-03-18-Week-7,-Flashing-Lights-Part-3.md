I found the flashing lights section without a doubt extremely challenging, you have to put the correct wire in each correct hole I was working with Oscar and Jaiman this week and it was interesting to work with someone else and find out how they make their progress as efficiently as possible.</td>

    <td>
This week was a mess of constant fiddling with the small wires and bulbs it took almost half the lesson to do the 4th exercise, I could improve this by practice and by paying more attention to the manual.</td>

I will take some more photos and find out how to put them on my blog. As I could not figure out how to do so.</td>
