I find this section section slightly more challenging than the previous as we had to use all of our knowledge to achieve it, I found that taking turns definitely makes it much more interesting to do.</td>

    <td>
This week took a long time (as it always does) due to the fiddliness of the wires but once all was in place it worked brilliantly. </td>

I will take some more photos and find out how to put them on my blog. As I could not figure out how to do so.</td>
