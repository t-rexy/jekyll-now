Fuse Beginning</td>

To start our fuse and progress a fair amount and improve our understanding of BASIC</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> 
Yes, Me and Rowan both successfully pushed through the first few sections in the manual</td>

  <tr>
    <td>
Getting the hang of copying the exact text from the manual to the screen took a bit of getting used to especially spotting where the spaces are. After that small hinderance we easily pushed through the stages</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
I need to improve my typing speed as I am quite slow so I prefer Rowan to type as he can touch type. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
I will try to read the booklet quicker and try to be as effective as I can be when doing the fuse box to push as quickly as I can to the robot arms</td>
  </tr>
