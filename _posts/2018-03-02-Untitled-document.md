  To further our understanding of BASIC and push push forward towards the robotic arms in the future</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> 
  Yes, we made a substantial amount of progress and furthered      our knowledge greatly we also made our way up to flashing lights which was very interesting and fun to do.</td>

I found the flashing lights section without a doubt extremely challenging, you have to put the correct wire in each correct hole I was working with Jaiman this week and it was interesting to work with someone else and find out how they make their progress as efficiently as possible.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

    <td>
This week not much limited our learning, nothing apart from the tricky placement of the wires and holes.</td>

    <td>
I will try to read the booklet quicker and try to be as effective as I can be when doing the fuse box to push as quickly as I can to the robot arms</td>
