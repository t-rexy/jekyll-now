  <tr>
    <td>
I found that luke taking the pictures while I worked was very useful and allowed us to progress much faster. We completed the first few exercises and we got the lights working, I also learned that whichever way you put the wire in it affects the current on the breadboard.</td>

    <td>
I don't have much to work on, the only thing I do have to do though is work a bit faster as sometimes I find my progress is very slow.</td>
